Here it is, we are finally live! After lot of efforts and lot of contributions from the community we can now say we have officially started the Keycap-Archivist project! This started as a little proof of concept and ended up as being a usefull tool for the collectors. 

I'm still stoked about people using it; but I have to mention it would not have been possible without all of you! I can only take credit for bringing up the tool, all of this would have never happenned without all the work involved in keeping all those catalogs up to date!

I want to thank all of you artisan enthusiast for bringing this hobby at this state. Keep on casting!

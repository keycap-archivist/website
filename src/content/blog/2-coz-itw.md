Questions

So let's introduce CozCaps, can you please present yourself for people who don't know you?

You started casting quite early as far as i remember, early 2015 right?

You were already in the mechanical hobby before for long time?

What was the trigger of starting to cast? Any maker that inspired you?

Your most famous sculpt is the No Escape (at least for me haha), you reached version 4 lately, was it the first sculpt you did?

Any specific inspiration, reference related to it?

Regarding updating the sculpt what's the trigger for it? Having new ideas, getting bored of the current version?

Through the colorways and sculpt you've explored a lot of techniques: Plain colors, swirled, marbles, sparkles and so on. Any one you prefer?

Will you cast idlekeys again? May we see a v3 in the future?

Do you have any maker / sculpt you follow these days?

Any little funny casting story you have to share?

That's already the end but do you same some few words to share for collectors?

Thanks
